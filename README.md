# Advent of Code Submissions

Every year since 2022 I have consistently participated in Advent of Code (despite usually stopping after the first week to move on to other things :grimacing:)... and since 2023 I used it as a way to learn and practice Rust. This repo is a collection of all of my advent of code repositories.

I have lost (I think I know where they are stored, but I don't have access to the machine at the moment) some of my old repositories though, and especially my first year of submissions in 2022, written in Python were definitely wiped out.

The code may be ugly... it may be slow... but it is my code through and through. Of course I am always willing to accept criticism (but my faint heart can only handle so much... ok?).
